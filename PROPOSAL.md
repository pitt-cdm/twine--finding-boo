Finding Ben

Christy, Russel, Tyller, and Jess are in a group, creating a story called Finding Ben. Essentially, the user, a monster in the Monster's Inc universe realizes that all of the doors used to contact the human world have been disintegrated by Randall's cousin Scandall, using a powerful solvent, DoorBeGone. The user starts in the Monster's Inc factory/workplace, and it's an adventure/race against the clock to find Ben before it's too late: will he remember the monster world by the time we find him? will we we be able to find the right door?


We are planning to divide the work by sections: essentially, having two main paths/choices that the user makes at the beginning that then branches out, and two team members work on each path. Also, we will meet with at least one other team member a few times, so in this way, we will work by compromise and consensus. 

General roles this week:
Christy - main narrative, outline/first few blocks of the story, to set the stage
Russel and Jess - one section/main path, will work on it throughout the week, esp Thursday for Jess
Christy/Tyller - the other section/main path, will work on it near the end of the week, esp Friday

Hello! For this collaboration project, we are using Twine to create an interactive/engaging narrative. Twine allows for
implementation of a lot of the CSS style edits that we learned about in the web design unit, it creates a 'blank slate'
on which to add images, background, or modified text to enhance the story visually, and also allows for implementation of sound, 
creating the layers upon layers of effect that makes a great story and game. 

Our narrative is called "Finding Ben": get ready to immerse yourself in a monster's world, 
racing against the clock to get your jobs back after an evil scheme has destroyed all but
two doors that have access to the human world, and to save the kid that makes going to work everyday worthwhile!

How did we collaborate? All four people on our project contributed, editing in different ways and at different times. Though we all edited the context/body of the story, Tyller and I focused primarily on this. Tyller is aiming to get outside feedback, as well, which will be super helpful to get insight into our project. Russell did a ton of work with the CSS stylesheet for the story, making it come alive with modifications to text, color, and we will hopefully be adding sound as well. Jess added to the storyline and helped immerse the user into the interactive story by drawing images we aim to incorporate into the background of our Twine.

As a 7 foot tall blue furry beast, you need about four egg-salad sandwiches and a whole bag of (text-color: &quot;green&quot;)[a](text-color: &quot;red&quot;)[pples] with peanut butter to fuel your afternoon. 

&quot;Remember,&quot; you say, giggling between bites,  &quot;when Randall was beat up and turned all sorts of (text-color: &quot;red&quot;)[c](text-color: &quot;orange&quot;)[o](text-color: &quot;yellow&quot;)[l](text-color: &quot;green&quot;)[o](text-color: &quot;blue&quot;)[r](text-color: &quot;purple&quot;)[s] before being (text-style: &quot;rumble&quot;)[thrown] through a random door in the middle of nowhere?&quot; you say to the other monsters on the Monster floor. &quot;That little girl wasn&#39;t afraid of him anymore!!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m so thankful that we quit scaring kids, and started making them [[laugh|The first sign of trouble]] instead.&quot; said your friend Monica Sterie.

You spear an (text-color: &quot;green&quot;)[a](text-color: &quot;red&quot;)[pple] with your claw and start to crunch on it when..

You notice a drip of (text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[thick], (text-color: &quot;green&quot;)[green] liquid oozing from the corner of the cafteria ceiling. 

[[Nudge Monica and ask about it]]

&quot;Ugh&quot;, Monica answers with an eye roll, &quot;probably just some leftover slime from Ray&#39;s slime gag he uses to make Tino laugh. 

&quot;You&#39;re right, it&#39;s probably [[nothing|Discuss the next shift]]&quot;.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="panic" tags="" position="232,521" size="100,100">The announcer, who usually speaks in *the* most (font: &quot;Bernard MT&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[monotonous] voice you could possibly imagine, suddenly sounds panicked... which makes you panic. 

&quot;(text-color: &quot;#e60000&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;rumble&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[CODE 2320]:WE ARE UNABLE TO GET MORE THAN TWO DOORS TO THE LAUGH-FLOOR.

IF YOU DO NOT HEAR FROM US BY FRIDAY, PLEASE BEGIN TO LOOK FOR OTHER EMPLOYMENT. WE APOLOGIZE, AND WE THANK YOU FOR ALL THE LAUGHTER YOU&#39;VE HELPED US CREATE&quot;

While everyone shuffles, frightened and yet kinda thankful for the day(s) off, you are feeling much more frightened. You [[look at Monica|get to the laugh floor]] and agree together what you will do. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="get to the laugh floor" tags="" position="232,660" size="100,100">Without saying anything to each other, you know you need to get to the laugh floor. You have to figure out what&#39;s going on here, and get to the bottom of this. 

You have to have at least one more laughter-filled evening with a the middle-schooler you&#39;ve been getting to know through your work over the last 5 years - Ben. He&#39;s having a tough time at school, and so making him laugh isn&#39;t the easiest job in the world, but it&#39;s what you love.

You and Monica see everyone going down the stairwell and out the doors. But you decide to go
[[To the locker room]]
[[Up the stairs]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="On the laugh floor" tags="" position="242,1131" size="100,100">.. and all of a sudden, you&#39;re on the laugh floor. You glimpse a lizard-like tail dart off to the left out of the corner of your eye, and you see that there is a *pile* of steamy green slime, with broken door handles and window shades among the goo. 

There are two doors in the middle of the laugh floor.

Scandall, Randall&#39;s cousin who somehow got a position at the laugh factory during the last year, begins to cackle. Then, he says,


&quot;Red and blue, it&#39;s up to you. One leads to Ben, unless that&#39;s not true. Do you sacrifice your life as you know it for a kid? Truly, the choice just comes down to two&quot;

&quot;Or, perhaps neither door leads to Ben, how tragic? What if I&#39;ve conjured up them both with magic? And the life you&#39;ve been living will all come untrue, whether you choose red or blue.&quot;

Monica rolls her eyes: &quot;Nothing Scandall says is helpful, it&#39;s never been. But we have to try.&quot;

You take a deep breath in, and choose:

[[the blue door]]
[[the red door]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="the red door" tags="" position="405,1255" size="100,100">Still a little weary about Scandal&#39;s intentions, but feeling as though you are running out of time to find Ben , you and Monica make your way through the red door. 
Stepping through the door, your feet squeak and you’re almost mowed down by a bunch of small humans bouncing an orange ball around. What is this game? Why are their faces so red? You’ve never seen so many tiny (yet smelly) humans before in your life.. You feel almost as out of breath as they do.

You look to Monica for reassurance, and she’s no longer behind you - instead, she’s picked up a ball and started to run with the tiny humans! They yell with excitement at their new team member, and jump with every swoosh of the net. You choose to [[play along]] too or are determined to [[exit]] this overwhelming place</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="To the locker room" tags="" position="88,779" size="100,100">As you get into the locker room, you go to your locker.

After fumbling with the combination, you finally get it. Under your oderant, you have a key. 

[[Take the key]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Up the stairs" tags="" position="368,896" size="100,100">Huffing and puffing (stairs are the worst, even when you have lots of energy), you make it up the first two flights. Instead of turning right up the next flight, though, you walk through a door that says &quot;Monsters Beware&quot; and before Monica can object, you&#39;re [[through the door|On the laugh floor]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Take the key" tags="" position="88,929" size="100,100">What&#39;s that for?&quot; asked Monica. 

&quot;Follow me and [[find out|up the elevator]].&quot; you say.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="up the elevator" tags="" position="88,1080" size="100,100">Running past all of the shower stalls, there&#39;s a sliding door that Monica had never seen before, and you had never used. You were hoping that nobody had changed the locks. 
 You [[use the key to open the door|On the laugh floor]], and it&#39;s an elevator.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="the blue door" tags="" position="75,1244" size="100,100">Despite Scandall&#39;s best efforts to convince you, you decide not to trust Scandall. After all, his name IS &quot;Scandall&quot;, right? 
Completely ignoring Scandall&#39;s suggestions, you [[push]] open the blue door. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="push" tags="" position="75,1394" size="100,100">On the other side of the blue door was a long, dark, and narrow tunnel. At the end of the long tunnel, you see a glimmer of light shining through. 

You looked back at Monica, who seemed confused, and said reassured her. &quot;Trust me, just follow me okay?&quot; 

You walk into the [[dark tunnel]], with Monica following closely behind you. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="dark tunnel" tags="" position="75,1544" size="100,100">As you and Monica step into the dark tunnel, you hear the blue door close behind you.

Monica, startled by the sound of the door, latched onto your arm and yelped.

&quot;Where are we? Where are we going?&quot;

Trying your best to hide the fear in your voice, you responded.

&quot;I&#39;m not too sure either... but my [[gut]]&#39;s telling me that this is the only way I&#39;m gonna be able to find Ben.&quot;

With Monica still latched tightly on your arm, you walk toward the [[light]] at the end of the tunnel. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="gut" tags="" position="28,1704" size="100,100">&quot;When in doubt, always follow your gut&quot;

That&#39;s what your dad always told you when you were still a little monster. You remember him telling you stories about how much of a brave monster your great-great-grandfather was, following his guts to not only save his little human girl who&#39;s been lost after an unfortunate door-breaking incident, but also fighting off an evil lizard monster named Randall while doing so.

Your great-great-grandfather was your hero.

&quot;When in doubt, always follow your [[gut|dark tunnel]]&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="light" tags="" position="170,1721" size="100,100">After walking through the tunnel for what it felt like an eternity, you and Monica finally made it to the end of the tunnel. At the end of the tunnel was yet another blue door. Through the cracks along the door were rays of sunlight that shone through.  

&quot;What do you think is on the other side of the door?&quot; asked Monica

&quot;Well... there&#39;s only one way to find out.&quot;

After a moment of hesitation, you and Monica looked at eachother, nodded in agreement, and [[pushed open]] the blue door. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="pushed open" tags="" position="173,1871" size="100,100">As soon as you pushed open the blue door, you were greeted with a cool breeze and a rays of warm sunlight.

As your eyes started to adjust to the bright, sunny sky, you looked around. You saw the familiar sight of tall skyscrapers, heard the familiar sound of the busy streets of downtown Pittsroargh, where you worked.

Then, you finally saw [[them]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="them" tags="" position="170,2021" size="100,100">Humans. 

There were humans everywhere.

You weren&#39;t in the world of monsters anymore...

You were on Earth, where humans live. 

You looked at Monica. Her normally green colored face was now almost as red as the apple she ate for lunch. She stood there flabbergasted. Completely speechless. 

You thought to yourself,

&quot;Now what?&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="play along" tags="" position="330,1405" size="100,100">Somehow, the kids are totally ok with two monsters running around with them.. You smile and realize that they’ve learned that monsters aren’t bad, just different! You’re caught up in the fun - lifting kids up to help them throw the ball through the net, blocking Monica from scoring for the other team, and, as you get tired

You realize that these kids are around Ben’s [[age]].

Maybe all the kids hang out in one place together? Maybe this is what he calls school? Do you think…..no….but maybe… he could be here? You look around, and scan all the faces, but he’s nowhere to be found. I guess what’s the odds that you’d find Ben here. You decide you need to leave this place quickly (link to move on)

The adults scream at the kids to line up, and one of the teachers sees a kid hanging off the rim and looks, frankly, in disbelief.

You have the urge to [[get out of here|exit]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="exit" tags="" position="480,1405" size="100,100">You scan this huge room for a way out. And run towards the first exit you see. Bursting through the heavy doors, you find yourself in a narrow hallway with lockers lining the wall. Is this some kind of long locker room? Are we back in the locker room at the factory? 

Then suddenly a loud Bell rings. Tiny humans begin appearing from multiple doors! Is this a human laugh factory? For kids?

“Ahhh” you hear Monica scream as tiny humans rush through the hallways, some entering into other doors, some making their ways to the lockers. You grab Monica and [[pull]] her into the first door you see.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="pull" tags="" position="480,1555" size="100,100">You&#39;ve entered into a dark and empty classroom. 
&quot;So,&quot; you think to yourself, &quot;this is a school for tiny humans.&quot;
Hope returns within you.. &quot;Maybe this is Ben&#39;s school, after all!&quot; You shout out to Monica. 
Monica, who has laid down sprawled on the ground, looks up at you. &quot;It&#39;s too much! There&#39;s so many of them!&quot; 
&quot;We have to go! We have to check every classroom and see which one Ben is in!&quot; You reach down to pull Monica up when suddenly the door swings open and a [[teacher enters]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="teacher enters" tags="" position="480,1705" size="100,100">The teacher comes in, begins preparing for the day: shuffling papers around on her desk, writing some words with a weird all white powder thing on a green board. The weirdest thing is though.. 

she hasn&#39;t noticed you or Monica, even though she&#39;s glanced in your direction many times. You think back to the gym, and how the adults looked at the kids as if they had dunked the small orange ball all by themselves.. 
[[Hm...|adults]]

Soon, you hear a bell, and the teacher smiles and stands in front of her desk. You and Monica manage to sneak behind a back cabinet just before a bunch of kids file into the classroom, hyped after gym class.

The teacher begins to call each student by name, followed by the student giggling, and then replying [[&quot;Here.&quot;|attendance]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="age" tags="" position="330,1555" size="100,100">Ben is around the age, he tells you, where kids aren&#39;t very nice. 

&quot;They don&#39;t share.&quot;

&quot;They don&#39;t care.&quot;

&quot;They don&#39;t even notice you.&quot;

A tear wells up in your eye as you recall the times Ben&#39;s told you this when you&#39;ve entered his room to tell jokes. All the times it&#39;s been so tough to make him laugh, but so worth it to replace the saddness with some joy, to remind him that he is known, seen, and loved. 

Your job is more than just an occupation, it&#39;s a place where you&#39;ve had real friendship. And that&#39;s something [[worth fighting for|play along]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="adults" tags="" position="671.6666666666667,1718.3333333333333" size="100,100">You and Monica glance at each other, seeming to process this information at the same time. 

You had heard stories from your great-great-grandfather that as tiny humans get older and bigger, they stop laughing so much.
They stop spending time at home, and they really don&#39;t even &lt;em&gt; believe &lt;/em&gt; that monsters exist. 

&quot;Maybe, when humans grow older,&quot; you think, &quot;they can&#39;t &lt;em&gt; see &lt;/em&gt; us anymore. 

Panic ensues. What if Ben is already an adult when you find him? It&#39;s been quite a while since you started looking? Who knows how time works here in the human world? What if.. he doesn&#39;t remember you...

Monica nudges you to [[bring you back to the present|teacher enters]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="art room transition" tags="" position="381.6666666666666,1974.9999999999998" size="100,100">Now, you&#39;re in the hallway. All the doors to the classrooms all look the same. But in front of one classroom, there&#39;s a trail of some paint splotches, leading to the water fountain and back. 

You smile and run [[toward it|art room]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="attendance" tags="" position="446.6666666666667,1821.6666666666665" size="100,100">You zone out a little as she calls name after name, but then she says &quot;Ben Miller?&quot;. 

.. 


.. 


..

A little boy exclaims, &quot;But I saw him on the bus this morning before gym class!&quot; The teacher signs a little shakily, and shakes her head. She marks that spot on her list with a red pen, and procedes with the other names. 

Monica whispers, &quot;If he isn&#39;t here, and he wans&#39;t in the gym, where is he?&quot;. You think about the things [[Ben likes to do|art]]

&quot;Ben isn&#39;t here, because he doens&#39;t quite like this dimension&quot;, you whisper back, knowingly. &quot;But, he does love art.&quot;

Thankfully, behind this back cabinet is another door that leaves the classroom. Bad news is that you&#39;re quite a large monster.. but you and Monica manage to squeeze through, without any of the kids [[noticing you.|art room transition]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="art" tags="" position="600,1954.9999999999998" size="100,100">Ben doens&#39;t have many toys or posters in his room. But he does have a lot of drawings, paintings, or collages from different magazines his mom gives him. He really appreciates how each medium gives his art a different feel, &quot;it&#39;s like I&#39;m working in another dimension&quot;, Ben always says, &quot;one where I feel much more at home.&quot;

You know exactly where Ben would [[be|attendance]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="art room" tags="" position="381.6666666666666,2125" size="100,100">Slowing down as you reach the room, you and Monica glance in through the door, to see Ben painting, but often wiping his eyes. 

You open the door, and his face absolutely lights up.

&quot;You&#39;re here! Look what I made!!&quot; Ben exclaims gleefully. 

You pick Ben up, hold him above your head as if he&#39;s an airplane, (him laughing the entire time) and then you stop and look at his painting. But, honestly, it&#39;s like you&#39;re looking in the mirror.. the painting is of you!

Monica says &quot;this painting actually makes you look ..good!&quot; 

Ben replies, &quot;well, good, my best friend should be represented well.&quot;

Best friend?!? AWWWWW. You begin to ask Ben how he&#39;s doing and retell all of your adventures thus far, when there an [[announcement]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="announcement" tags="" position="381.6666666666666,2275" size="100,100">You hear Scandalls voice, saying:

&quot;You may have found Ben, but that does not bode well for your job, or for anyone else&#39;s. The Laugh Factory still only has access through the two doors, and not for long. There&#39;s no antidote for the DoorBeGone here, and you can&#39;t get back to the monster world the way you came.

So, congratulations... You now have a choice: come back with me to the monster world and never see Ben again, or stay in the human world forever..

The announcement [[ends|final decision]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="final decision" tags="" position="450.33333333333326,2531" size="100,100">Scandall then enters the art room. He&#39;s gotten to know the school&#39;s layout well over the past few weeks.

&quot;So, what&#39;ll it be?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m staying here, Scandall. My job was never about the work, it was about the kids. So, I can get to know more kids here, too, and maybe help them remember us monsters even as they grow up.&quot;

With that, a shocked Scandall slinks out of the room, and leaves. 

Ben looks at you with the biggest, happiest eyes. &quot;YOU&#39;RE STAYING?? You can help me find all kinds of things to paint!!&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes I can.&quot;

As a 7 foot tall blue furry beast, you need about four egg-salad sandwiches and a whole bag of apples with peanut butter to fuel your afternoon. 

&quot;Remember,&quot; you say, giggling between bites,  &quot;when Randall was beat up and turned all sorts of colors before being thrown through a random door in the middle of nowhere?&quot; you say to the other monsters on the Monster floor. &quot;That little girl wasn&#39;t afraid of him anymore!!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m so thankful that we quit scaring kids, and started making them [[laugh|The first sign of trouble]] instead.&quot; said your friend Monica Sterie.

Your mind races, because you&#39;ve never encountered this signal.

You spear an apple with your claw and start to crunch on it when..

You notice a drip of thick, green liquid oozing from the corner of the cafteria ceiling.

&quot;Ugh&quot;, Monica answers with an eye roll, &quot;probably just some leftover slime from Ray&#39;s slime gag he uses to make Tino laugh. 

&quot;You&#39;re right, it&#39;s probably [[nothing|Discuss the next shift]]&quot;.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="panic" tags="" position="232.33333333333331,525" size="100,100">The announcer, who usually speaks in *the* most monotonous voice you could possibly imagine, suddenly sounds panicked... which makes you panic. 

&quot;CODE 2320: WE ARE UNABLE TO GET MORE THAN TWO DOORS TO THE LAUGH-FLOOR. WE HAVE SECURITY AND OUR I.T. DEPARTMENT DOING EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO RETREIVE OTHER DOORS. YOU HAVE THE REST OF THE DAY OFF. IF YOU DO NOT HEAR FROM US BY FRIDAY, PLEASE BEGIN TO LOOK FOR OTHER EMPLOYMENT. WE APOLOGIZE, AND WE THANK YOU FOR ALL THE LAUGHTER YOU&#39;VE HELPED US CREATE&quot;

While everyone shuffles, frightened and yet kinda thankful for the day(s) off, you are feeling much more frightened. You [[look at Monica|get to the laugh floor]] and agree together what you will do. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="get to the laugh floor" tags="" position="232.33333333333331,660" size="100,100">Without saying anything to each other, you know you need to get to the laugh floor. You have to figure out what&#39;s going on here, and get to the bottom of this. 

You have to have at least one more laughter-filled evening with a the middle-schooler you&#39;ve been getting to know through your work over the last 5 years - Ben. He&#39;s having a tough time at school, and so making him laugh isn&#39;t the easiest job in the world, but it&#39;s what you love.

You and Monica see everyone going down the stairwell and out the doors. But you decide to go
[[To the locker room]]
[[Up the stairs]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="On the laugh floor" tags="" position="242.33333333333331,1131.6666666666665" size="100,100">.. and all of a sudden, you&#39;re on the laugh floor. You glimpse a lizard-like tail dart off to the left out of the corner of your eye, and you see that there is a *pile* of steamy green slime, with broken door handles and window shades among the goo. 

There are two doors in the middle of the laugh floor.

After fumbling with the combination, you finally get it. Under your oderant, you have a key.

 You [[use the key to open the door|On the laugh floor]], and it&#39;s an elevator.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>

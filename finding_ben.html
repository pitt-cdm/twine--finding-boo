As a 7 foot tall blue furry beast, you need about four egg-salad sandwiches and a whole bag of (text-color: &quot;green&quot;)[a](text-color: &quot;red&quot;)[pples] with peanut butter to fuel your afternoon. 

&quot;Remember,&quot; you say, giggling between bites,  &quot;when Randall was beat up and turned all sorts of (text-color: &quot;red&quot;)[c](text-color: &quot;orange&quot;)[o](text-color: &quot;yellow&quot;)[l](text-color: &quot;green&quot;)[o](text-color: &quot;blue&quot;)[r](text-color: &quot;purple&quot;)[s] before being (text-style: &quot;rumble&quot;)[thrown] through a random door in the middle of nowhere?&quot; you say to the other monsters on the Monster floor. &quot;That little girl wasn&#39;t afraid of him anymore!!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m so thankful that we quit scaring kids, and started making them [[laugh|The first sign of trouble]] instead.&quot; said your friend Monica Sterie.

Lunch comes to an abrupt end, however, when an announcement comes over the speaker: 
&quot;This is a (text-color: &quot;red&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;rumble&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[CODE 2320], I repeat, a (text-color: &quot;red&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;rumble&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[CODE 2320]&quot;.

You notice a drip of (text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[thick], (text-color: &quot;green&quot;)[green] liquid oozing from the corner of the cafteria ceiling.

The announcer, who usually speaks in *the* most (font: &quot;Bernard MT&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[monotonous] voice you could possibly imagine, suddenly sounds panicked... which makes you panic. 

&quot;(text-color: &quot;#e60000&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;rumble&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[CODE 2320]:WE ARE UNABLE TO GET MORE THAN TWO DOORS TO THE LAUGH-FLOOR.

While everyone shuffles, frightened and yet kinda thankful for the day(s) off, you are feeling much more frightened. You [[look at Monica|get to the laugh floor]] and agree what you will do. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="get to the laugh floor" tags="" position="892,1010" size="100,100">Without saying anything to each other, you know you need to get to the laugh floor. You have to figure out what&#39;s going on here, and get to the bottom of this. 

You have to have at least one more laughter-filled evening with the middle-schooler you&#39;ve been getting to know through your work over the last 5 years - Ben. He&#39;s having a tough time at school, and so making him laugh isn&#39;t the easiest job in the world, but it&#39;s what you love.

You and Monica see everyone going down the stairwell and out the doors. But you decide to go
[[To the locker room]]
[[Up the stairs]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="On the laugh floor" tags="" position="892,1755" size="100,100">.. and all of a sudden, you&#39;re on the laugh floor. You glimpse a lizard-like tail (text-style: &quot;blink&quot;)[dart off] to the left out of the corner of your eye, and you see that there is a *pile* of steamy green (text-color: &quot;green&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[slime], with broken door handles and window shades among the goo. 

There are two doors in the middle of the laugh floor.

Scandall, Randall&#39;s cousin who somehow got a position at the laugh factory during the last year, begins to cackle. Then, he says,


&quot;(text-color: &quot;Red&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[Red] and (text-color: &quot;Blue&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[blue], it&#39;s up to you. One leads to Ben, unless that&#39;s not true. Do you sacrifice your life as you know it for a kid? Truly, the choice just comes down to two&quot;

&quot;Or, perhaps neither door leads to Ben, how tragic? What if I&#39;ve conjured up them both with magic? And the life you&#39;ve been living will all come untrue, whether you choose (text-color: &quot;Red&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[red] or (text-color: &quot;Blue&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[blue].&quot;

Monica rolls her eyes: &quot;Nothing Scandall says is helpful, it&#39;s never been. But we have to try.&quot;

You take a deep breath in, and choose:

[[the blue door]]
[[the red door]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="the red door" tags="" position="1055,2025" size="100,100">Still a little weary about Scandal&#39;s intentions, but feeling as though you are running out of time to find Ben , you and Monica make your way through the (text-color: &quot;red&quot;)[red] door. 
Stepping through the door, your feet squeak and you’re almost mowed down by a bunch of (font: &quot;ink free&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[small] humans bouncing an (text-color: &quot;#EE8502&quot;)[orange] ball around. What is this game? Why are their faces so (text-color: &quot;red&quot;)[red]? You’ve never seen so many (font: &quot;ink free&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[tiny] (yet smelly) humans before in your life.. You feel almost as out of breath as they do.

You look to Monica for reassurance, and she’s no longer behind you - instead, she’s picked up a ball and started to run with the (font: &quot;ink free&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[tiny] humans! They yell with excitement at their new team member, and jump with every (text-style: &quot;blink&quot;)[(text-color: &quot;#EE8502&quot;)[s](text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[w](text-color: &quot;#EE8502&quot;)[oo](text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[s](text-color: &quot;#EE8502&quot;)[h]] of the net.

After fumbling with the combination, you finally get it. Under your (text-style: &quot;shadow&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;green&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[oderant], you have a key. 

[[Take the key]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Up the stairs" tags="" position="1051,1216" size="100,100">&lt;audio src= &quot;https://github.com/pitt-cdm/twine--finding-boo/blob/master/sounds/stairs.wav?raw=true&quot; autoplay&gt; &lt;/audio&gt;
Huffing and puffing (stairs are the worst, even when you have lots of energy), you make it up the first two flights. Instead of turning right up the next flight, though, you walk through a door that says 

&lt;div class=&quot;MonstersBeware&quot;&gt; Monsters Beware&lt;/div&gt; 

and before Monica can object, you&#39;re [[through the door|On the laugh floor]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Take the key" tags="" position="684,1362" size="100,100">What&#39;s that for?&quot; asked Monica.

You were hoping that nobody had changed the locks. 
 You [[use the key to open the door|On the laugh floor]], and it&#39;s an elevator.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="the blue door" tags="" position="821,2017" size="100,100">Despite Scandall&#39;s best efforts to convince you, you decide not to trust Scandall. After all, his name IS &quot;Scandall&quot;, right? 
Completely ignoring Scandall&#39;s suggestions, you [[push]] open the (text-color: &quot;Blue&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[blue] door. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="push" tags="" position="818,2174" size="100,100">&lt;audio src= &quot;https://github.com/pitt-cdm/twine--finding-boo/blob/master/sounds/door%20open.flac?raw=true&quot; autoplay&gt; &lt;/audio&gt;
On the other side of the blue door was a long, dark, and narrow tunnel. At the end of the long tunnel, you see a glimmer of light shining through. 

You looked back at Monica, who seemed confused, and say to reassure her. &quot;Trust me, just follow me okay?&quot; 

You walk into the [[dark tunnel]], with Monica following closely behind you. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="dark tunnel" tags="" position="828,2317" size="100,100">&lt;audio src= &quot;https://github.com/pitt-cdm/twine--finding-boo/blob/master/sounds/Door%20Slam.wav?raw=true&quot; autoplay&gt; &lt;/audio&gt;

Monica, startled by the sound of the door, latched onto your arm and yelped.

&quot;Where are we? Where are we going?&quot;

Trying your best to hide the fear in your voice, you responded.

&quot;I&#39;m not too sure either... but my [[gut]]&#39;s telling me that this is the only way I&#39;m gonna be able to find Ben.&quot;

With Monica still latched tightly on your arm, you walk toward the [[light]] at the end of the (font: &quot;Cooper Black&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;Black&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[tunnel]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="gut" tags="" position="601,2320" size="100,100">&lt;div class=&quot;flashback&quot;&gt;&quot;When in doubt, always follow your gut&quot;

That&#39;s what your dad always told you when you were still a little monster.

Your great-great-grandfather was your hero.

&quot;When in doubt, always follow your [[gut|dark tunnel]]&quot;&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="light" tags="" position="836,2497" size="100,100">After walking through the (font: &quot;Cooper Black&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;Black&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[tunnel] for what it felt like an eternity, you and Monica finally made it to the end of the (font: &quot;Cooper Black&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;Black&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[tunnel]. At the end of the (font: &quot;Cooper Black&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;Black&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[tunnel] was yet another (text-color: &quot;blue&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[blue] door. Through the cracks along the door were rays of (text-color: &quot;gold&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;fade-in-out&quot;)[sunlight] that shone through.  

&quot;What do you think is on the other side of the door?&quot; asked Monica

&quot;Well... there&#39;s only one way to find out.&quot;

After a moment of hesitation, you and Monica looked at eachother, nodded in agreement, and [[pushed open]] the (text-color: &quot;blue&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[blue] door. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="pushed open" tags="" position="827,2652" size="100,100">&lt;audio src= &quot;https://github.com/pitt-cdm/twine--finding-boo/blob/master/sounds/Busy%20City.wav?raw=true&quot; autoplay&gt; &lt;/audio&gt;
As soon as you pushed open the (text-color: &quot;blue&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[blue] door, you were greeted with a cool breeze and a rays of warm (text-color: &quot;gold&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;fade-in-out&quot;)[sunlight].

As your eyes started to adjust to the bright, sunny sky, you looked around. You saw the familiar sight of tall skyscrapers, heard the familiar sound of the busy streets of downtown 

&lt;div class=&quot;Pittsroargh&quot;&gt;Pittsroargh&lt;/div&gt; 
where you worked.

Then, you finally saw [[them]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="them" tags="" position="830,2804" size="100,100">Humans. 

There were [[humans]] everywhere.

You weren&#39;t in the world of monsters anymore...

You were on Earth, where humans live. 

You looked at Monica. Her normally (text-color: &quot;green&quot;)[green] colored face was now almost as (text-color: &quot;red&quot;)[red] as the (text-color: &quot;green&quot;)[a](text-color: &quot;red&quot;)[pple] she ate for lunch. She stood there flabbergasted. Completely speechless. 

You thought to yourself,

[[&quot;Now what?&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="play along" tags="" position="1253,2479" size="100,100">Somehow, the kids are totally ok with two monsters running around with them.. You smile and realize that they’ve learned that monsters aren’t bad, just different! You’re caught up in the fun - lifting kids up to help them throw the (text-color: &quot;#EE8502&quot;)[b](text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[al](text-color: &quot;#EE8502&quot;)[l] through the net, blocking Monica from scoring for the other team, and, as you get tired

You realize that these kids are around Ben’s [[age]].

Maybe all the kids hang out in one place together? Maybe this is what he calls school? Do you think…..no….but maybe… he could be here? You look around, and scan all the faces, but he’s nowhere to be found. I guess what’s the odds that you’d find Ben here. You decide you need to leave this place quickly (link to move on)

The adults scream at the kids to line up, and one of the teachers sees a kid hanging off the rim and looks, frankly, in disbelief.

You have the urge to [[get out of here|exit]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="exit" tags="" position="1090,2388" size="100,100">You scan this huge room for a way out. And run towards the first exit you see.

(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[“Ahhh”] you hear Monica scream as (font: &quot;ink free&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[tiny] humans rush through the hallways, some entering into other doors, some making their ways to the lockers.

Hope returns within you.. &quot;Maybe this is Ben&#39;s school, after all!&quot; You shout out to Monica. 
Monica, who has laid down sprawled on the ground, looks up at you. &quot;It&#39;s too much! There&#39;s so many of them!&quot; 
&quot;We have to go! We have to check every classroom and see which one Ben is in!&quot; You reach down to pull Monica up when suddenly the door (text-style: &quot;blink&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[swings] open and a [[teacher enters]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="teacher enters" tags="" position="1110,2834" size="100,100">The teacher comes in, begins preparing for the day: (text-style: &quot;shudder&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[shuffling] papers around on her desk, (text-style: &quot;fade-in-out&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[writing] some words with a weird all white powder thing on a (text-color: &quot;#368804&quot;)[green] board. The weirdest thing is though.. 

(set: $color to &quot;red&quot;)
she hasn&#39;t noticed you or Monica, even though she&#39;s glanced in your direction many times. You think back to the gym, and how the adults looked at the kids as if they had dunked the (font: &quot;ink free&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[small] (text-color: &quot;orange&quot;)[orange] (text-color: &quot;#EE8502&quot;)[b](text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[al](text-color: &quot;#EE8502&quot;)[l] all by themselves.. 
[[Hm...|adults]]

Soon, you hear a bell, and the teacher smiles and stands in front of her desk. You and Monica manage to sneak behind a back cabinet just before a bunch of kids file into the classroom, hyped after gym class.

The teacher begins to call each student by name, followed by the student giggling, and then replying [[&quot;Here.&quot;|attendance]]

&quot;They don&#39;t share.&quot;

&quot;They don&#39;t care.&quot;

&quot;They don&#39;t even notice you.&quot;

A tear wells up in your eye as you recall the times Ben&#39;s told you this when you&#39;ve entered his room to tell jokes. All the times it&#39;s been so tough to make him laugh, but so worth it to replace the saddness with some joy, to remind him that he is known, seen, and loved.

They stop spending time at home, and they really don&#39;t even &lt;em&gt; believe &lt;/em&gt; that monsters exist.&lt;/div&gt; 

&quot;Maybe, when humans grow older,&quot; you think, &quot;they can&#39;t &lt;em&gt; see &lt;/em&gt; us anymore. 

Panic ensues. What if Ben is already an adult when you find him? It&#39;s been quite a while since you started looking? Who knows how time works here in the human world? What if.. he doesn&#39;t remember you...

She marks that spot on her list with a (text-color: &quot;red&quot;)[red] pen, and procedes with the other names. 

Monica whispers, &quot;If he isn&#39;t here, and he wans&#39;t in the gym, where is he?&quot;. You think about the things [[Ben likes to do|art]]

&quot;Ben isn&#39;t here, because he doens&#39;t quite like this dimension&quot;, you whisper back, knowingly. &quot;But, he does love art.&quot;

Thankfully, behind this back cabinet is another door that leaves the classroom. Bad news is that you&#39;re quite a large monster.. but you and Monica manage to (text-style: &quot;condense&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[squeeze] through, without any of the kids [[noticing you.|art room transition]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="art" tags="" position="556,3817" size="100,100">&lt;div class=&quot;flashback&quot;&gt;Ben didn&#39;t have many toys or posters in his room. But he did have a lot of drawings, paintings, or collages from different magazines his mom gave him. He really appreciates how each medium gives his art a different feel, &quot;it&#39;s like I&#39;m working in another dimension&quot;, Ben always says, &quot;one where I feel much more at home.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

(if: $color is &quot;red&quot;)[You know exactly where Ben would [[be|attendance]]]

(if: $color is &quot;blue&quot;) [[[It makes sense that the art would still be around|in Ben&#39;s house]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="art room" tags="" position="1141,3758" size="100,100">Slowing down as you reach the room, you and Monica glance in through the door, to see Ben painting, but often wiping his eyes. 

You open the door, and his face absolutely (text-color: &quot;gold&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;blink&quot;)[light]s up.

&quot;You&#39;re here! Look what I made!!&quot; Ben exclaims gleefully. 

You pick Ben up, hold him above your head as if he&#39;s an airplane, (him laughing the entire time) and then you stop and look at his painting. But, honestly, it&#39;s like you&#39;re looking in the (text-color: &quot;blue&quot;)[mirror](text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[l](text-color: &quot;blue&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;mirror&quot;)[mirror].. the painting is of you!

Monica says &quot;this painting actually makes you look ..good!&quot; 

Ben replies, &quot;well, good, my best friend should be represented well.&quot;

Best friend?!? (text-color: &quot;#DA2FC5&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[AWWWWW]. You begin to ask Ben how he&#39;s doing and retell all of your adventures thus far, when there an [[announcement]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="announcement" tags="" position="1170,4131" size="100,100">You hear Scandalls voice, saying:

&lt;div class=&quot;announcement&quot;&gt;&quot;You may have found Ben, but that does not bode well for your job, or for anyone else&#39;s. The Laugh Factory still only has access through the two doors, and not for long. There&#39;s no antidote for the DoorBe(text-style: &quot;fade-in-out&quot;)[Gone] here, and you can&#39;t get back to the monster world the way you came.

So, congratulations... You now have a choice: come back with me to the monster world and never see Ben again, or stay in the human world forever..
&lt;/div&gt;

The announcement [[ends|final decision]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="final decision" tags="" position="1233,4487" size="100,100">Scandall then enters the art room. He&#39;s gotten to know the school&#39;s layout well over the past few weeks.

&quot;So, what&#39;ll it be?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m staying here, Scandall. My job was never about the work, it was about the kids. So, I can get to know more kids here, too, and maybe help them remember us monsters even as they grow up.&quot;

With that, a shocked Scandall (text-style: &quot;emboss&quot;)[slinks] out of the room, and leaves. 

Ben looks at you with the (text-style: &quot;expand&quot;)+(font: &quot;Goudy Stout&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[biggest], happiest eyes. (text-color: &quot;black&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[&quot;YOU&#39;RE STAYING??] You can help me find all kinds of things to paint!!&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes I can.&quot;

The End

Want to [[begin again|Remember]]?

Let&#39;s look at the [[Credits]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="humans" tags="" position="888,2994" size="100,100">These weren&#39;t just little humans like you were used to. 
They were tall, dressed in suit&#39;s, and walking... very quickly. 

You look up at the sun and realize it must be about mid-day, which would explain the bustle of the seemingly daunting crowd- [[lunch time]]!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="&quot;Now what?&quot;" tags="" position="764,2990" size="100,100">You glance at Monica to see if she has any more confidence in the matter. Welp, she looks just as lost. Great. 

You look at the sun and assume it must be around mid-day... Which would explain the bustling suits whizzing by; it must be [[lunch time]].

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="lunch time" tags="" position="814,3225" size="100,100">You are suddenly very aware of your (text-color: &quot;blue&quot;)[blue] fur amongst these humans. You grab Monica and duck behind a building. 

&quot;Listen, I think our best bet is to go inside, find a hiding place before we cause a scene, and come up with a plan together&quot;, you say. 

Monica agrees with wide eyes, as you take her hand and (text-style: &quot;emboss&quot;)[slink] through the [[revoling door]] to your left. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="revoling door" tags="" position="814,3365" size="100,100">Lurking against the wall, you scurry to the nearest hallway.

In this hallway, there&#39;s doors... lot&#39;s of them. Each door has a small rectangle tag to the left, with a window towards the top. 

Still unsure, you turn back to Monica and give a gesture down the hallway. 

It&#39;s either down the hallway, or back out to the streets... with all those people, and no way were you going back out there. Too much risk. 

Okay, down the [[hallway]] it is. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="hallway" tags="" position="821,3507" size="100,100">&lt;audio src= &quot;https://github.com/pitt-cdm/twine--finding-boo/blob/master/sounds/Office%20Ambiance.wav?raw=true&quot; autoplay&gt; &lt;/audio&gt;
Trying your very best to suck in and stay as (font: &quot;ink free&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[small] as possible for a very, very (text-style: &quot;expand&quot;)+(font: &quot;Goudy Stout&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[large] monster, you start your way down the hallway. 

You pass the first door and peer in. A man, balding, sits at a desk with his brows furrowed towards his computer. &quot;Jeremy Smith&quot;, the rectangle by the door reads. Suddenly, you realize you must be in a work place. 

(set: $color to &quot;blue&quot;)
He sneezes, and even though you try to hide out of sight of his doorway, when he stands up to get a tissue, he looks directly at you.. and [[nothing happens..why?|adults]]

[[Footsteps]] start down the hall, getting louder and louder, coming towards you.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Footsteps" tags="" position="821,3644" size="100,100">&lt;audio src= &quot;https://github.com/pitt-cdm/twine--finding-boo/blob/master/sounds/footstep.wav?raw=true&quot; autoplay&gt; &lt;/audio&gt;
Even though these adult humans seem to be unable to see you, you still feel a bit uncomfortable in their presence. You grab Monica by the shoulder and launch yourself into the next room. 

Falling to the ground in the (text-style: &quot;blur&quot;)[dimly] lit room, you gather yourself- thank goodness there wasn&#39;t another balding man in this one. 

&quot;Phew&quot;, Monica exclaims. &quot;I&#39;m tired of running around. Is he even going to be here?&quot; 

Starting to get up, you come face to face with a name tag. 

	[[&quot;Benjamin, CEO&quot; |Ben]]
	
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Ben" tags="" position="829,3801" size="100,100">You whip your head around the office to the pictures on the wall. 

(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[&quot;Monica....&quot;]

(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;emboss&quot;)[&quot;Monica!!!!&quot;] 

You point first to the square frame, a picture of a man posing in front of a house with a kid hanging on his arm. &quot;That&#39;s Ben!! I&#39;d recognize those facial expressions and glasses anywhere!&quot;

But, he&#39;s not here today.. Where is he, then?

You hear two people whispering in the [[hallway|child is sick]]


You realize that to get their attention, you&#39;d have to make noise. So, you and Monica pick up a picture in Ben&#39;s office, and [[drop it on the ground|Ben&#39;s new home]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="child is sick" tags="" position="972,3806" size="100,100">&quot;I don&#39;t really understand why Ben is willing to risk his position to go home anytime his kid is &#39;sick&#39; &quot; says a women dressed in an all (text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[black] pantsuit, wearing (text-color: &quot;#A70F0B&quot;)[dark red] lipstick.

A man in a similarly dreary outfit, taking himself all too seriously, scoffs in agreement, saying &quot;So much for being the CEO, while we sit here and do all the work.&quot;

You and Monica roll your eyes - you know Ben, and he&#39;s a hard worker. Your (text-color: &quot;red&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;rumble&quot;)[anger rises] because you realize that these people are sitting around talking about Ben and not doing any work themselves! 

But, you knew that you have a goal. To find [[Ben]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="Ben&#39;s new home" tags="" position="835,3931" size="100,100">The two people from the hallway rush in, confused as to how the picture frame fell. But, they didn&#39;t feel empathy for too long - they proceeded with their mean jokes toward Ben.

They made fun of his house, the yard, and even the street that he lived on, talking about how &quot;ordinary&quot; it was for being a CEO, blah, blah, blah. 

You and Monica didn&#39;t have time for most of their jibberish, but held onto the pieces of information that you&#39;d need to find Ben. When the two finally sauntered back to their offices, you ran down the stairs of the office building in search of Ben&#39;s new home. 

Since you heard the office people talking about &quot;Squirrel Hill&quot;, you and Monica hitch a ride on the next [[bus]] with that title flashing on the side of it </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="bus" tags="" position="831,4073" size="100,100">&lt;audio src= &quot;https://github.com/pitt-cdm/twine--finding-boo/blob/master/sounds/Bus.wav?raw=true&quot; autoplay&gt; &lt;/audio&gt;
Thankfully, you and Monica didn&#39;t need to (text-style: &quot;condense&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[squeeze] on the bus, because your claws let you kinda just cling to the sides. This really helped you be able to see which house was the one from Ben&#39;s picture. 

Finally, at the second to last stop in Squirrel Hill, you see it. You hardly wait until the bus stops moving to get out and (text-style: &quot;blink&quot;)[dart] in!

Before you can practically plow through the front door, though, Monica stops you, and points to a tube of (text-color: &quot;blue&quot;)[blue] paste on the ground, that kinda looks like [[toothpaste|repair the doors]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="repair the doors" tags="" position="828,4210" size="100,100">&quot;What do you think this is?&quot; Monica says, guesturing to the (text-color: &quot;blue&quot;)[blue] paste. 

You pick it up, and read it aloud: 
(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[&quot;DooRestore - antidote to DoorBeGone&quot;.] 


(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)[&quot;WOAHHHHHHHHH!!&quot;] yells Monica. &quot;This will repair all the damages Scandall caused back at the laugh factory, and help people get their jobs back!&quot;

Somehow, the repairing of the doors doesn&#39;t excite you as much as what&#39;s on the inside of Ben&#39;s door.. but you give Monica your best smile. 

Can we go [[in|in Ben&#39;s house]] now? 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="in Ben&#39;s house" tags="" position="835,4350" size="100,100">(set: $color to &quot;blue&quot;)
As you enter, the house smells of chicken noodle soup. You see artwork across the kitchen and living room that vaguely reminds you of Ben&#39;s [[artwork|art]]

You and Monica don&#39;t want to scare anyone in the house, (and you&#39;re still holding on hope that Ben still remembers you), and so, you say &quot;Hello!&quot;

Ben whirls around, practically spilling the tea he just made for his son all over himself. 

He looks at you and Monica, (text-style: &quot;expand&quot;)+(font: &quot;Goudy Stout&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;black&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[wide-eyed], and then shakes his head as if to get rid of the a scary thought. 

&quot;Did you see us?&quot; you ask. 

Ben&#39;s child doens&#39;t let Ben have time to reply when he sits up and says &quot;Dad, those are the monsters you&#39;ve told me about!!! We have to make them soup too!&quot;

At this point, not only did Ben think he saw monsters he had thought he made up in his childhood, but his own kid thinks he sees them too. He can&#39;t believe that this is happening, but he trusts his child, and he knows that he&#39;s been sick for a while now, and so if this is what is cheering him up, then by golly, let&#39;s [[have tea with monsters]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="have tea with monsters" tags="" position="971,4493" size="100,100">You, Monica, Ben, and Ben&#39;s son spend the whole afternoon together. Ben catches glimpses of you, but he can hear you loud and clear when you speak. You realize that even though you wanted to find the Ben you left, that this Ben is truly wonderful - a great father, who cares more about his family than impressing those mean people at work, and who still loves art more than ever. 

Even when you go back to the laugh factory and Ben and the other kids the monsters have gotten to know grow up, that there will still be more kids! And that&#39;s exciting too.

After the tea party ends, you make your way back to the (font: &quot;Cooper Black&quot;)+(text-color: &quot;Black&quot;)+(text-style: &quot;bold&quot;)[tunnel] on the other side of the city, and return to the laugh factory.

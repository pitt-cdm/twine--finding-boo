As a 7 foot tall blue furry beast, you need about four egg-salad sandwiches and a whole bag of apples with peanut butter to fuel your afternoon. 

&quot;Remember,&quot; you say, giggling between bites,  &quot;when Randall was beat up and turned all sorts of colors before being thrown through a random door in the middle of nowhere?&quot; you say to the other monsters on the Monster floor. &quot;That little girl wasn&#39;t afraid of him anymore!!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m so thankful that we quit scaring kids, and started making them [[laugh|The first sign of trouble]] instead.&quot; said your friend Monica Sterie.

Your mind races, because you&#39;ve never encountered this signal.

You spear an apple with your claw and start to crunch on it when..

You notice a drip of thick, green liquid oozing from the corner of the cafteria ceiling. 

[[Nudge Monica and ask about it]]
[[Discuss the next shift]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Nudge Monica and ask about it" tags="" position="70,425" size="100,100">&quot;What do you think that is?&quot;

&quot;Ugh&quot;, Monica answers with an eye roll, &quot;probably just some leftover slime from Ray&#39;s slime gag he uses to make Tino laugh. 

&quot;You&#39;re right, it&#39;s probably [[nothing|Discuss the next shift]]&quot;.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="panic" tags="" position="232,521" size="100,100">The announcer, who usually speaks in *the* most monotonous voice you could possibly imagine, suddenly sounds panicked... which makes you panic. 

&quot;CODE 2320: WE ARE UNABLE TO GET MORE THAN TWO DOORS TO THE LAUGH-FLOOR. WE HAVE SECURITY AND OUR I.T. DEPARTMENT DOING EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO RETREIVE OTHER DOORS. YOU HAVE THE REST OF THE DAY OFF. IF YOU DO NOT HEAR FROM US BY FRIDAY, PLEASE BEGIN TO LOOK FOR OTHER EMPLOYMENT. WE APOLOGIZE, AND WE THANK YOU FOR ALL THE LAUGHTER YOU&#39;VE HELPED US CREATE&quot;

While everyone shuffles, frightened and yet kinda thankful for the day(s) off, you are feeling much more frightened. You [[look at Monica|get to the laugh floor]] and agree together what you will do. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="get to the laugh floor" tags="" position="232,660" size="100,100">Without saying anything to each other, you know you need to get to the laugh floor. You have to figure out what&#39;s going on here, and get to the bottom of this. 

You have to have at least one more laughter-filled evening with a the middle-schooler you&#39;ve been getting to know through your work over the last 5 years - Ben. He&#39;s having a tough time at school, and so making him laugh isn&#39;t the easiest job in the world, but it&#39;s what you love.

You and Monica see everyone going down the stairwell and out the doors. But you decide to go
[[To the locker room]]
[[Up the stairs]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="On the laugh floor" tags="" position="242,1131" size="100,100">.. and all of a sudden, you&#39;re on the laugh floor. You glimpse a lizard-like tail dart off to the left out of the corner of your eye, and you see that there is a *pile* of steamy green slime, with broken door handles and window shades among the goo. 

There are two doors in the middle of the laugh floor.

KEY DIALOGUE BETWEEN YOU AND SCANDALL WHICH SETS THE STAGE, AND WHERE HE TRIES TO CONVINCE YOU TO CHOOSE ONE DOOR OR NEITHER, BECAUSE YOU&#39;LL NEVAAAA FIND BEN OR ANY KID YOU CARE ABOUT (christy will edit this)

[[the blue door]]
[[the red door]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="the red door" tags="" position="405,1255" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="To the locker room" tags="" position="88,779" size="100,100">As you get into the locker room, you go to your locker.

After fumbling with the combination, you finally get it. Under your oderant, you have a key. 

[[Take the key]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Up the stairs" tags="" position="368,896" size="100,100">Huffing and puffing (stairs are the worst, even when you have lots of energy), you make it up the first two flights. Instead of turning right up the next flight, though, you walk through a door that says &quot;Monsters Beware&quot; and before Monica can object, you&#39;re [[through the door|On the laugh floor]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Take the key" tags="" position="88,929" size="100,100">What&#39;s that for?&quot; asked Monica. 

&quot;Follow me and [[find out|up the elevator]].&quot; you say.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="up the elevator" tags="" position="88,1080" size="100,100">Running past all of the shower stalls, there&#39;s a sliding door that Monica had never seen before, and you had never used. You were hoping that nobody had changed the locks. 
 You [[use the key to open the door|On the laugh floor]], and it&#39;s an elevator.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="the blue door" tags="" position="75,1244" size="100,100">Despite Scandall&#39;s best efforts to convince you, you decide not to trust Scandall. After all, his name IS &quot;Scandall&quot;, right? 
Completely ignoring Scandall&#39;s suggestions, you [[push]] open the blue door. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="push" tags="" position="75,1394" size="100,100">On the other side of the blue door was a long, dark, and narrow tunnel. At the end of the long tunnel, you see a glimmer of light shining through. 

You looked back at Monica, who seemed confused, and said reassured her. &quot;Trust me, just follow me okay?&quot; 

You walk into the [[dark tunnel]], with Monica following closely behind you. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="dark tunnel" tags="" position="75,1544" size="100,100">As you and Monica step into the dark tunnel, you hear the blue door close behind you.

Monica, startled by the sound of the door, latched onto your arm and yelped.

&quot;Where are we? Where are we going?&quot;

Trying your best to hide the fear in your voice, you responded.

&quot;I&#39;m not too sure either... but my [[gut]]&#39;s telling me that this is the only way I&#39;m gonna be able to find Ben.&quot;

With Monica still latched tightly on your arm, you walk toward the [[light]] at the end of the tunnel. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="gut" tags="" position="28,1704" size="100,100">&quot;When in doubt, always follow your gut&quot;

That&#39;s what your dad always told you when you were still a little monster. You remember him telling you stories about how much of a brave monster your great-great-grandfather was, following his guts to not only save his little human girl who&#39;s been lost after an unfortunate door-breaking incident, but also fighting off an evil lizard monster named Randall while doing so.

Your great-great-grandfather was your hero.

&quot;When in doubt, always follow your [[gut|dark tunnel]]&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="light" tags="" position="170,1721" size="100,100">After walking through the tunnel for what it felt like an eternity, you and Monica finally made it to the end of the tunnel. At the end of the tunnel was yet another blue door. Through the cracks along the door were rays of sunlight that shone through.  

&quot;What do you think is on the other side of the door?&quot; asked Monica

&quot;Well... there&#39;s only one way to find out.&quot;

After a moment of hesitation, you and Monica looked at eachother, nodded in agreement, and [[pushed open]] the blue door. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="pushed open" tags="" position="170,1871" size="100,100">As soon as you pushed open the blue door, you were greeted with a cool breeze and a rays of warm sunlight.

As your eyes started to adjust to the bright, sunny sky, you looked around. You saw the familiar sight of tall skyscrapers, heard the familiar sound of the busy streets of downtown Pittsroargh, where you worked.

Then, you finally saw [[them]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="them" tags="" position="170,2021" size="100,100">Humans. 

There were humans everywhere.

You weren&#39;t in the world of monsters anymore...

You were on Earth, where humans live. 

You looked at Monica. Her normally green colored face was now almost as red as the apple she ate for lunch. She stood there flabbergasted. Completely speechless. 

You thought to yourself,

&quot;Now what?&quot;</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
